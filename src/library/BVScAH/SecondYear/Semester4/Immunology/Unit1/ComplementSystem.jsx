      <h2>Complement System</h2>

      <p>
        The complement system is a group of approximately 30 plasma and
        membrane-associated proteins that work together to enhance immune and
        inflammatory responses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Complement proteins include components C1 to C9, the properdin system,
        and regulatory proteins. Some act as enzymes, some regulate the system,
        and others participate as structural components.
      </p>

      <h2>Complement as an Enzymatic Cascade</h2>

      <p>
        Complement works as a sequential enzymatic cascade similar to the
        coagulation pathways. Activation of one component activates the next
        component, producing amplification of the immune response.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because uncontrolled complement activation can damage normal tissues,
        the system contains several regulatory mechanisms to stop the cascade
        when it is no longer required.
      </p>

      <h2>Pathways of Complement Activation</h2>

      <p>The complement system can be activated through three major pathways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Classical pathway:</strong> Mainly activated by
          antigen-antibody complexes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lectin pathway:</strong> Activated when lectins bind
          carbohydrates on microbial surfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alternative pathway:</strong> Activated by microbial
          surfaces and other appropriate foreign or abnormal surfaces.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Although the three pathways have different mechanisms of initiation,
        they converge at the activation of C3 and ultimately lead to the
        terminal pathway and formation of the membrane attack complex.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Classical Pathway</h2>

      <p>
        The classical pathway is mainly associated with the adaptive immune
        response because it is usually activated by antigen-antibody
        complexes. IgM and IgG are the major antibodies involved.
      </p>

      <h3>Activation of C1</h3>

      <p>
        C1 is the first component of the classical pathway. It consists of
        three subunits:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>C1q</li>
        <li>C1r</li>
        <li>C1s</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        C1q recognizes and binds to the Fc region of antibodies present in an
        antigen-antibody complex. This causes activation of C1r, which then
        activates C1s.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C1q → C1r → C1s</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Activation of C4</h3>

      <p>
        Activated C1s cleaves C4 into two fragments:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>C4a:</strong> Released into the fluid phase and contributes
          to inflammation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C4b:</strong> Attaches to the target surface and participates
          in formation of the C3 convertase.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Activation of C2</h3>

      <p>
        C4b binds C2, and C1s cleaves C2 into C2a and C2b. The functional
        classical pathway C3 convertase is:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C4b2a = C3 Convertase</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Activation of C3</h3>

      <p>
        C3 convertase cleaves C3 into:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>C3a:</strong> An anaphylatoxin involved in inflammation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C3b:</strong> Binds to the target surface, acts as an
          opsonin, and participates in C5 convertase formation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Formation of C5 Convertase</h3>

      <p>
        C3b combines with the classical pathway C3 convertase:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C4b2a + C3b → C4b2a3b</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C4b2a3b = C5 Convertase</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Classical Pathway Summary</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Antigen-antibody complex → C1 → C4 → C2 → C4b2a → C3 → C4b2a3b → C5
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2>2. Lectin Pathway</h2>

      <p>
        The lectin pathway is activated without antibodies. It recognizes
        specific carbohydrates present on microbial surfaces.
      </p>

      <h3>Mannan-Binding Lectin</h3>

      <p>
        Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) binds to carbohydrates such as mannose on
        the surface of microorganisms.
      </p>

      <p>
        MBL is associated with enzymes called MBL-associated serine proteases:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>MASP-1</li>
        <li>MASP-2</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Activated MASP-2 performs functions similar to C1s and activates C4 and
        C2.
      </p>

      <p>
        This produces the same C3 convertase as the classical pathway:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C4b2a = C3 Convertase</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Lectin Pathway Summary</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Microbial carbohydrate → MBL → MASP → C4 + C2 → C4b2a → C3
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2>3. Alternative Pathway</h2>

      <p>
        The alternative pathway is an important component of innate immunity
        because it does not require antibodies for activation.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can be activated by microbial surfaces, particularly bacteria and
        yeasts, abnormal cells, immune aggregates, and certain foreign
        materials.
      </p>

      <h3>Phases of the Alternative Pathway</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Tick-over phase</li>
        <li>Activation phase</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tick-Over Phase</h3>

      <p>
        The tick-over phase occurs continuously at a low level in normal
        extracellular fluid.
      </p>

      <p>
        C3 undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to form C3i.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C3 → C3i</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the presence of Mg²⁺, C3i binds Factor B. Factor D then cleaves
        Factor B into Ba and Bb.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bb remains associated with C3i and forms a fluid-phase C3 convertase.
        This produces additional C3a and C3b.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most C3b generated in the fluid phase is rapidly degraded or
        inactivated unless it binds to a suitable activating surface.
      </p>

      <h3>Activation Phase</h3>

      <p>
        The activation phase occurs when C3b binds to an appropriate microbial
        or foreign surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        C3b binds Factor B, which is then cleaved by Factor D. This produces:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C3bBb = Alternative Pathway C3 Convertase</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Role of Properdin</h3>

      <p>
        Properdin stabilizes the alternative pathway C3 convertase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C3bBb + Properdin → Stable C3 Convertase</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Feedback Amplification</h3>

      <p>
        The alternative pathway produces a powerful feedback amplification
        loop. C3bBb cleaves more C3, generating more C3b. The additional C3b
        deposits on the microbial surface and produces more C3 convertase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, the alternative pathway is particularly important for
        amplification of complement activation.
      </p>

      <h3>Alternative Pathway C5 Convertase</h3>

      <p>
        Additional C3b combines with C3bBb:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C3bBb + C3b → C3bBbC3b</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C3bBbC3b = C5 Convertase</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>4. Terminal Pathway</h2>

      <p>
        The terminal pathway is common to all three complement pathways. It
        begins when C5 convertase cleaves C5.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C5 → C5a + C5b</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>C5a</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Potent inflammatory mediator</li>
        <li>Anaphylatoxin</li>
        <li>Powerful chemoattractant</li>
        <li>Attracts neutrophils and other inflammatory cells</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C5b</h3>

      <p>
        C5b initiates formation of the membrane attack complex.
      </p>

      <h3>Membrane Attack Complex</h3>

      <p>
        C5b sequentially associates with C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9
        molecules.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C5b + C6 + C7 + C8 + C9 → C5b-9</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C5b-9 = Membrane Attack Complex (MAC)</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        MAC forms transmembrane pores in the target cell membrane. This causes
        an osmotic imbalance, water influx, cell swelling, and ultimately cell
        rupture.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>MAC → Membrane pore → Osmotic imbalance → Cell lysis</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Biological Effects of Complement</h2>

      <h3>1. Cytolysis</h3>

      <p>
        The membrane attack complex inserts into the membrane of susceptible
        target cells and forms pores. The resulting osmotic imbalance can cause
        swelling and rupture of the cell.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C5b-9 → MAC → Cytolysis</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>2. Inflammation</h3>

      <p>
        C3a and C5a are important complement fragments involved in inflammation
        and are called anaphylatoxins. C5a is more potent than C3a.
      </p>

      <p>Major effects include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Vasodilation</li>
        <li>Increased vascular permeability</li>
        <li>Fluid and protein leakage into tissues</li>
        <li>Tissue edema</li>
        <li>Recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages</li>
        <li>Increased phagocytic activity</li>
        <li>Mast-cell degranulation</li>
        <li>Release of inflammatory mediators</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        C5a is particularly important for chemotaxis, attracting inflammatory
        cells toward the site of infection or tissue injury.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Opsonization</h3>

      <p>
        Opsonization is the coating of microorganisms or particulate antigens
        with molecules such as IgG and C3b to make them easier for phagocytes
        to recognize and engulf.
      </p>

      <p>
        Phagocytes have receptors for both antibody and complement:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fc receptors:</strong> Recognize the Fc region of IgG.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CR1:</strong> Recognizes C3b.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When a microorganism is coated with both IgG and C3b, the interaction
        between the microorganism and phagocyte is greatly enhanced.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>IgG + C3b coating → Fc receptor + CR1 → Enhanced phagocytosis</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>4. Removal of Immune Complexes</h3>

      <p>
        Complement also helps remove particulate antigens and immune complexes
        from the circulation.
      </p>

      <h3>Immune Adherence</h3>

      <p>
        Red blood cells possess CR1 receptors that can bind C3b-coated immune
        complexes.
      </p>

      <p>
        These antigen-coated RBCs pass through the liver and spleen, where
        macrophages capture and remove the immune complexes by phagocytosis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          C3b-coated immune complex → CR1 on RBC → Liver/Spleen → Macrophage →
          Removal
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Complement Regulation</h2>

      <p>
        Complement activation must be carefully controlled because excessive
        activation can cause inflammation and damage to normal host tissues.
      </p>

      <h3>Major Regulatory Mechanisms</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>C1 inhibitor (C1-INH):</strong> Inhibits the activity of C1r
          and C1s.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>C4-binding protein (C4BP):</strong> Helps disrupt the
          classical pathway C3 convertase and facilitates inactivation of C4b.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Factor I:</strong> Cleaves and inactivates C3b and C4b.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>DAF:</strong> Decay-accelerating factor helps disrupt
          complement convertases.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>CR1:</strong> Participates in regulation and removal of
          complement-coated immune complexes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>MCP:</strong> Membrane cofactor protein helps protect normal
          host cells from complement activation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Important Complement Components</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>C1:</strong> Initiates the classical pathway.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C3:</strong> Central component of complement activation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C3a:</strong> Anaphylatoxin and inflammatory mediator.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C3b:</strong> Major opsonin and part of C5 convertase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C5a:</strong> Powerful anaphylatoxin and chemoattractant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C5b:</strong> Initiates MAC formation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>C5b-9:</strong> Membrane attack complex.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Properdin:</strong> Stabilizes the alternative pathway C3
          convertase.
        </li>
      </ul>
